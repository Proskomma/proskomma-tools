\v 1 And God speaks all these words, saying,
\v 2 “I [am] your God YHWH, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants.
\v 3 You have no other Gods before Me.
\v 4 You do not make a carved image for yourself, or any likeness which [is] in the heavens above, or which [is] in the earth beneath, or which [is] in the waters under the earth.
\v 5 You do not bow yourself to them, nor serve them: for I, your God YHWH, [am] a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on a third and on a fourth [generation] of those hating Me,
\v 6 and doing kindness to thousands, of those loving Me and keeping My commands.
\v 7 You do not take up the Name of your God YHWH for a vain thing, for YHWH does not acquit him who takes up His Name for a vain thing.
\v 8 Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it;
\v 9 six days you labor and have done all your work,
\v 10 and the seventh day [is] a Sabbath to your God YHWH; you do not do any work, you, and your son, and your daughter, your manservant, and your handmaid, and your livestock, and your sojourner who is within your gates—
\v 11 for [in] six days YHWH has made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and rests in the seventh day; therefore YHWH has blessed the Sabbath day and sanctifies it.
\v 12 Honor your father and your mother, so that your days are prolonged on the ground which your God YHWH is giving to you.
\v 13 You do not murder.
\v 14 You do not commit adultery.
\v 15 You do not steal.
\v 16 You do not answer [with] a false testimony against your neighbor.
\v 17 You do not desire the house of your neighbor, you do not desire the wife of your neighbor, or his manservant, or his handmaid, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything which [is] your neighbor’s.”
\v 18 And all the people are seeing the voices, and the flames, and the sound of the horn, and the mountain smoking; and the people see, and move, and stand far off,
\v 19 and say to Moses, “Speak with us, and we hear, and do not let God speak with us, lest we die.”
\v 20 And Moses says to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to try you, and in order that His fear may be before your faces—that you do not sin.”
\v 21 And the people stand far off, and Moses has drawn near to the thick darkness where God [is].
\v 22 And YHWH says to Moses, “Thus you say to the sons of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken with you from the heavens;
\v 23 you do not make gods of silver and gods of gold [to be] with Me—you do not make [any idol] for yourselves.
\v 24 You make an altar of earth for Me, and you have sacrificed on it your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings, your flock and your herd; in every place where I cause My Name to be remembered I come to you, and have blessed you.
\v 25 And if you make an altar of stones for Me, you do not build them of hewn work; when you have waved your tool over it, then you defile it;
\v 26 neither do you go up by steps on My altar, that your nakedness is not revealed on it.
